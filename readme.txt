Adds admin color schemes for the visually impaired.

== Description ==

Input fields on the WordPress admin screens have been nearly invisible since version 2.7.  The problem was so severe that Matt suggested I make a plugin to override core CSS values for anyone who wanted more contrast.  Following community feedback, I created this extra plugin specifically for high contrast.

This plugin adds Admin Color Scheme options that dramatically change the appearance of form fields, table rows, and background colors in the admin pages.  It is not intended to follow the design principles of the built-in style sheets.  If this is too much for your needs, then also consider my plugin with more subtle effects called [Fix Admin Contrast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fix-admin-contrast/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `high-contrast-admin` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click "Howdy" in the upper-right corner of the admin bar to visit your profile.
1. Select one of the High Contrast color schemes on your profile.

This is a zero-configuration plugin.  There are no settings.

Deactivation removes everything except the files you uploaded.  Users will gracefully reset
to the Default color scheme.  There is no "uninstall" necessary.
